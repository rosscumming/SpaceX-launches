As part of a brief, to create a React App which retrieves historic and future SpaceX launches and presents them in a list view. This data is fetched from the [SpaceX API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API).

The user can currently select from a list of launch years for each rocket launch and the list will filter and display these. Sorting launches by ascending or descending order is also possible.

## Things i'd do with more time

Due to time constaints, there is a lot that i'd like to have implemented.

These include: 

* Make the app responsive to work on all devices. Currently it's designed for desktop use.
* Look more into useReducer() / redux and try to implement this. I think this would work well with the order sorting and filtering.
* Try making custom hooks to help keep single responsibility between functions and components.
* Unit tests. Currently there are no unit tests for this application, having some tests would help prevent bugs and ensure the app works as intended.


I had a lot of fun making this app and plan to incorporate more features at a later date!
